Manages the signatures of the different components of a POG file so
that signatures are calculated on-demand and only once.

Two different techniques are used to calculate signatures on-demand.
Either the signature is stored in a map as the value component of a pair
and is calculated only if the key is not found in the map.
Or the signature is stored as an optional and is calculated only if the
optional is null.

The relevant components of the POG files are:

- The Define elements, i.e., sequences of predicates. Each Define element has a
  name and a list of predicates. The signature of the Define element is the
  union of the signatures of the predicates in the list. It is accessed by
  the name of the Define element.
- for each Group element, the signature of the group hypotheses
- for each local hypothesis in a Group element, the signature of the hypothesis
- for each SimpleGoal element, the signature of the goal.

Then for each SimpleGoal element, the signature for the corresponding proof
obligation is the union of the following signatures:

- the referenced Define elements
- the group hypotheses in the group of the SimpleGoal
- the referenced local hypotheses
- the goal.

The Define elements are identified by their name.
The POGroup elements are identified by their position in the `pos` variable of
the `Pog`. The local hypotheses elements in a POGroup are identified by (the
position of the group) and their position in the `hyps` variable of the
corresponding POGroup object. The SimpleGoal elements are identified by (the
position of the group) and their position in the `simpleGoals` variable of the
corresponding `POGroup` object.
