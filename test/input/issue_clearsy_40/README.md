**Warning**

This file has been manually crafted by reproduce a bug.  The bug was
triggered by the presence of two homonymous symbols, with different
types. This is possible and legal as these symbols are in different
scopes (in a local hypothesis for the first goal, in a global
hypothesis in the second goal).
