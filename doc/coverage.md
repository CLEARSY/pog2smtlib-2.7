# Coverage

## Introduction

This document presents the coverage of the language of B proof obligation files in the so-called POG format.

We consider several layers of coverage, in increasing order :

* not covered : the tool fails to encode proof obligations containing the construct.
* syntactic coverage : the tool produces an SMTLIB-2.7 construct that represents the B construct, but not the theory elements that would let a SMT solver prove a valid proof obligation containing the construct.
* semantic coverage : the tool produces an SMTLIB-2.7 construct that represents the B construct, and the theory elements that would let a SMT solver prove a valid proof obligation containing the construct.

Coverage is justified based on the test bench of the tool. For each construct, the corresponding tests are identified.
