## How to Contribute

If you find a bug, please follow these steps to report it:

2. **Provide a clear description** of the bug, including:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior vs. actual behavior
   - Environment details (e.g., OS, browser version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement:

1. **Search for existing issues** that might be similar or related.
2. **Provide a clear description** of the proposed enhancement, why it would be useful, and any potential design considerations.

## Contributing Code

To contribute code, follow these steps:

1. **Contributor agreement**: Contributions are accepted provided CLEARSY holds a copy of the [Contributor License Agreement](#contributor-license-agreement-cla) signed by the authors of the contribution.

2. **Identify issue**: Every contribution should correspond to a project [issue](https://github.com/CLEARSY/b2smtlib/issues). So make sure an issue corresponding to the contribution exists.

3. **Obtain issue acceptance**: If the issue has not been created by a project maintainer, ask that a maintainer accepts the issue (i.e., its contribution will eventually be considered for merging).

4. **Create a new branch**: Create a branch associated to this issue, giving the name `issue/#number`.

5. **Make your changes**: Implement your fix or feature. We kindly ask you to:

- Follow coding conventions (as defined in the `src/.clang-format` file).
- In code comments, use Doxygen markup whenever applicable.

6. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes with a clear, concise message.

7. **Open a pull request**: Once you consider your work is ready, and verified it has not introduced a regression, open a pull request.

8. **Pull request check-list**:

- If this is your first contribution, attach a copy of the [Contributor License Agreement](#contributor-license-agreement-cla) with your signature to the pull request.
- Make sure your branch is up-to-date with the main branch.
- Make sure your branch did not introduce any regression.
- In your PR description, explain what changes you've made and why. Link to any related issues.
- Review process: Your PR will be reviewed by one of the project maintainers. Be prepared for feedback and changes.
