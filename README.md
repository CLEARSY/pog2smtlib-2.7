# B2SMTLIB

![Build & Test](https://github.com/CLEARSY/b2smtlib/actions/workflows/cmake-multi-platform.yml/badge.svg)

B2SMTLIB is a translator from pog to SMT-LIB 2.6.

## To do list

- For a pure typing predicate such as `xx: INTEGER`, the signature contains `:_<INT>` and `INTEGER`, which entails that all
  the prerequisites of `INTEGER` are pulled. **We do not want this**
- BAST does not read the `RichTypeInfos` table from the POG file when it exists. We need to add this feature, which includes
  reading the `richtypref` attribute when available instead of the `typref` attribute.
- Refactorize symbol name generation so that smtSymbol functions are called to fill the templates from the derived classes
  of `BConstruct`.
- Have `POGsignatures` be a member of `POGtranslations` maybe?
- Cover the full list of B expression operators.

## Usage

```sh
b2smtlib -i <input.pog> -o <output>
```
